Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Implementation

We can implement DFS using a stack for iterative traversal, incorporating `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` where possible.

```javascript
const dfs = (graph, start) => {
  const visited = new Set();
  const stack = [start];
  const result = [];

  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const node = stack.pop();

    if (!visited.has(node)) {
      visited.add(node);
      result.push(node);

      // Get the neighbors and filter out visited ones
      const neighbors = (graph[node] || []).filter(neighbor => !visited.has(neighbor));

      // Add the unvisited neighbors to the stack
      neighbors.reduce((acc, neighbor) => {
        acc.push(neighbor);
        return acc;
      }, stack);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

// Example usage
const graph = {
  A: ['B', 'C'],
  B: ['A', 'D', 'E'],
  C: ['A', 'F'],
  D: ['B'],
  E: ['B', 'F'],
  F: ['C', 'E']
};

console.log(dfs(graph, 'A')); // ['A', 'C', 'F', 'E', 'B', 'D']
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `visited` is a set to keep track of visited nodes.
   - `stack` is an array used to manage the nodes to be processed in LIFO order.
   - `result` is an array to store the order of nodes as they are visited.

2. **Processing Nodes**:
   - While the stack is not empty, take the top node (`pop`).
   - If the node hasn't been visited, mark it as visited, and add it to the `result`.
   - Get the neighbors of the node from the graph. Use `filter` to get only the unvisited neighbors.
   - Use `reduce` to push the unvisited neighbors onto the stack.

### Detailed Version with `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`

Here's a more detailed version, demonstrating the use of `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`:

```javascript
const dfsDetailed = (graph, start) => {
  const visited = new Set();
  const stack = [start];
  const result = [];

  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const node = stack.pop();

    if (!visited.has(node)) {
      visited.add(node);
      result.push(node);

      const neighbors = graph[node] || [];

      // Filter unvisited neighbors
      const unvisitedNeighbors = neighbors.filter(neighbor => !visited.has(neighbor));

      // Map to transform neighbors (if necessary)
      const transformedNeighbors = unvisitedNeighbors.map(neighbor => neighbor);

      // Reduce to add neighbors to the stack
      transformedNeighbors.reduce((acc, neighbor) => {
        acc.push(neighbor);
        return acc;
      }, stack);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

// Example usage
console.log(dfsDetailed(graph, 'A')); // ['A', 'C', 'F', 'E', 'B', 'D']
```

### Explanation of the Detailed Version

1. **Initialization**:
   - Same as the basic version.

2. **Processing Nodes**:
   - Same as the basic version with additional usage of `map`.

3. **Filter Unvisited Neighbors**:
   - `filter` is used to get only the unvisited neighbors.

4. **Map to Transform Neighbors**:
   - `map` is used to transform neighbors if needed. In this case, it directly maps neighbors to themselves, but you can use it for more complex transformations.

5. **Reduce to Add Neighbors to Stack**:
   - `reduce` is used to push each unvisited neighbor onto the stack.

This implementation shows how you can incorporate `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` in DFS, though the core DFS logic (processing nodes depth-first using a stack) remains the same.
