Binary search is a classic algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the algorithm narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half. The process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Here's a solution to the binary search problem in JavaScript that incorporates `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` where possible.

### Implementation

```javascript
const binarySearch = (arr, target) => {
  let low = 0;
  let high = arr.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    const guess = arr[mid];

    if (guess === target) {
      return mid;
    }
    if (guess > target) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
  }

  return -1; // Target not found
};

// Example usage
const array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11];
const target = 7;

console.log(binarySearch(array, target)); // 3 (index of target value 7)
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Initialize `low` to the start of the array and `high` to the end of the array.
   - Compute the midpoint `mid` of the current interval.
   - Compare the value at `mid` with the `target`:
     - If `guess` (value at `mid`) equals `target`, return `mid`.
     - If `guess` is greater than `target`, adjust `high` to `mid - 1`.
     - If `guess` is less than `target`, adjust `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Repeat until `low` exceeds `high`.

### Usage of `map`, `reduce`, `filter`

The binary search algorithm inherently does not lend itself to the direct use of `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` due to its iterative, conditional nature. However, we can demonstrate the use of these functions in the context of binary search to manipulate and analyze the input array.

Here is a conceptual example using `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` to prepare and analyze the array before performing the binary search:

```javascript
// Preparing the array (this step is usually not necessary if the array is already sorted)
const prepareArray = (arr) => {
  // Example of transforming the array using map
  const transformedArray = arr.map(num => num * 2);

  // Example of filtering the array to remove unwanted elements
  const filteredArray = transformedArray.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

  // Example of reducing the array to find the sum of elements
  const sum = filteredArray.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);

  console.log('Transformed Array:', transformedArray);
  console.log('Filtered Array:', filteredArray);
  console.log('Sum of Filtered Array:', sum);

  return filteredArray;
};

// Example usage
const initialArray = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11];
const targetValue = 14;

const preparedArray = prepareArray(initialArray);
console.log(binarySearch(preparedArray, targetValue)); // Output depends on the transformed array
```

### Explanation of the Example with `map`, `reduce`, `filter`:

1. **Transform the Array**:
   - `map` is used to multiply each element by 2.

2. **Filter the Array**:
   - `filter` is used to retain only the even elements.

3. **Reduce the Array**:
   - `reduce` is used to compute the sum of the filtered array elements.

4. **Binary Search**:
   - Perform the binary search on the prepared array.

Although the core binary search algorithm does not naturally incorporate `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`, these methods can be used to preprocess or analyze the data in a way that complements the binary search process.
