### Singleton Pattern in JavaScript (Imperative Style)

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

#### Example Code

Here's an example implementation of the Singleton Pattern in JavaScript using an imperative programming style:

```javascript
// Singleton class
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  static getInstance() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  someMethod() {
    console.log('Some method of the singleton instance');
  }
}

// Usage
const singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(singleton1 === singleton2); // Output: true

singleton1.someMethod(); // Output: Some method of the singleton instance
```

### Explanation

1. **Singleton Class**: The `Singleton` class has a private static variable `instance` that holds the single instance of the class. The constructor ensures that only one instance of the class is created.
2. **getInstance Method**: The `getInstance` method provides a global point of access to the singleton instance. It creates the instance if it doesn't exist and returns it.
3. **Usage**: Clients access the singleton instance using the `getInstance` method and can call methods on it as needed.

### Usage

The Singleton Pattern is used in scenarios where:

1. **Single Instance Requirement**: Only one instance of a class should exist throughout the application's lifecycle.
2. **Global Access Point**: A single point of access is needed to a shared resource or service.
3. **Resource Management**: Limited resources (e.g., database connections, thread pools) need to be shared among multiple parts of the system.

#### Common Use Cases

- **Configuration Management**: Providing global access to application configuration settings.
- **Logger Instances**: Ensuring that only one instance of a logger is used for logging throughout the application.
- **Cache Management**: Maintaining a single cache instance to store frequently accessed data.

### Summary

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In an imperative programming style, the singleton class manages its single instance through a static method (`getInstance`) and ensures that only one instance is created. This pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a single instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system and to provide a shared resource or service.
