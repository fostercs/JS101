Decorator Software Design Pattern in JavaScript Using Functional Programming

Summary:
This demonstration illustrates implementing the decorator software design pattern in JavaScript using a functional programming approach. We'll leverage `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions where applicable. Following the implementation, I'll delineate the pros and cons of each usage of the functional style in the solution.

Implementation:
```javascript
// Define a base component
const Component = () => {
  return {
    operation: () => {
      console.log('Base operation');
    },
  };
};

// Define decorators
const decoratorA = component => ({
  operation: () => {
    console.log('Decorator A before operation');
    component.operation();
    console.log('Decorator A after operation');
  },
});

const decoratorB = component => ({
  operation: () => {
    console.log('Decorator B before operation');
    component.operation();
    console.log('Decorator B after operation');
  },
});

// Example usage of decorators
const baseComponent = Component();
const decoratedComponentA = decoratorA(baseComponent);
const decoratedComponentB = decoratorB(decoratedComponentA);

// Execute operations
baseComponent.operation();
decoratedComponentA.operation();
decoratedComponentB.operation();

// Using map, filter, and reduce
const decorators = [decoratorA, decoratorB];

const decoratedComponent = decorators.reduce((component, decorator) => decorator(component), baseComponent);

// Execute operation on the decorated component
decoratedComponent.operation();
```

Pros and Cons of Functional Style Usage:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Clarity**: Functional programming often leads to cleaner, more readable code due to its focus on functions and immutability.
   - **Composition**: Functions can be composed together easily, allowing for reusable and modular code.
   - **Avoids Side Effects**: Emphasizes immutability, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects.
   - **Concurrency**: Immutability makes it easier to reason about concurrent code.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Performance Overhead**: Functional programming can sometimes lead to performance overhead due to the creation of new data structures instead of mutating existing ones.
   - **Learning Curve**: Functional programming concepts can be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms, leading to a steeper learning curve.
   - **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging functional code, especially deeply nested compositions, can be challenging compared to imperative code.
   - **Abstraction Overhead**: Overusing functional abstractions like map, filter, and reduce can sometimes obfuscate the intent of the code for those unfamiliar with functional programming paradigms.
