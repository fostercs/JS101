Facade Software Design Pattern in JavaScript Using Functional Programming

Summary:
This demonstration showcases implementing the facade software design pattern in JavaScript using a functional programming approach. We'll employ `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions where applicable. After presenting the implementation, I'll outline the pros and cons of each usage of the functional style in the solution.

Implementation:
```javascript
// Define complex subsystems
const SubsystemA = () => ({
  operationA: () => {
    console.log('Subsystem A operation');
  },
});

const SubsystemB = () => ({
  operationB: () => {
    console.log('Subsystem B operation');
  },
});

const SubsystemC = () => ({
  operationC: () => {
    console.log('Subsystem C operation');
  },
});

// Define the facade
const Facade = () => {
  const subsystemA = SubsystemA();
  const subsystemB = SubsystemB();
  const subsystemC = SubsystemC();

  return {
    operation: () => {
      subsystemA.operationA();
      subsystemB.operationB();
      subsystemC.operationC();
    },
  };
};

// Example usage of the facade
const facade = Facade();
facade.operation();

// Using map, filter, and reduce
const subsystems = [SubsystemA, SubsystemB, SubsystemC];

const facadeUsingFP = subsystems.reduce((facade, Subsystem) => {
  const subsystem = Subsystem();
  return {
    operation: () => {
      facade.operation();
      subsystem.operation();
    },
  };
}, Facade());

// Example usage of the functional facade
facadeUsingFP.operation();
```

Pros and Cons of Functional Style Usage:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Clarity**: Functional programming often leads to cleaner, more readable code due to its focus on functions and immutability.
   - **Composition**: Functions can be composed together easily, allowing for reusable and modular code.
   - **Avoids Side Effects**: Emphasizes immutability, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects.
   - **Concurrency**: Immutability makes it easier to reason about concurrent code.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Performance Overhead**: Functional programming can sometimes lead to performance overhead due to the creation of new data structures instead of mutating existing ones.
   - **Learning Curve**: Functional programming concepts can be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms, leading to a steeper learning curve.
   - **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging functional code, especially deeply nested compositions, can be challenging compared to imperative code.
   - **Abstraction Overhead**: Overusing functional abstractions like map, filter, and reduce can sometimes obfuscate the intent of the code for those unfamiliar with functional programming paradigms.
