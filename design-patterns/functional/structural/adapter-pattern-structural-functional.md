Adapter Software Design Pattern in JavaScript Using Functional Programming

Summary:
This demonstration presents implementing the adapter software design pattern in JavaScript using a functional programming approach. We'll utilize `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions where applicable. After showcasing the implementation, I'll outline the pros and cons of each usage of the functional style in the solution.

Implementation:
```javascript
// Define existing interfaces
const OldInterface = {
  request: () => {
    console.log('Old interface request');
  },
};

const NewInterface = {
  call: () => {
    console.log('New interface call');
  },
};

// Adapter function to adapt OldInterface to NewInterface
const adapter = oldInterface => ({
  call: oldInterface.request,
});

// Example usage of the adapter
const oldObject = OldInterface;
const adaptedObject = adapter(oldObject);

// Now, you can use the NewInterface methods with oldObject
adaptedObject.call();

// Using map, filter, and reduce
const objects = [OldInterface, OldInterface, OldInterface];

const adaptedObjects = objects.map(adapter);

// Now, you can use the NewInterface methods with each old object
adaptedObjects.forEach(obj => obj.call());
```

Pros and Cons of Functional Style Usage:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Clarity**: Functional programming often leads to cleaner, more readable code due to its focus on functions and immutability.
   - **Composition**: Functions can be composed together easily, allowing for reusable and modular code.
   - **Avoids Side Effects**: Emphasizes immutability, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects.
   - **Concurrency**: Immutability makes it easier to reason about concurrent code.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Performance Overhead**: Functional programming can sometimes lead to performance overhead due to the creation of new data structures instead of mutating existing ones.
   - **Learning Curve**: Functional programming concepts can be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms, leading to a steeper learning curve.
   - **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging functional code, especially deeply nested compositions, can be challenging compared to imperative code.
   - **Abstraction Overhead**: Overusing functional abstractions like map, filter, and reduce can sometimes obfuscate the intent of the code for those unfamiliar with functional programming paradigms.
