Factory Software Design Pattern in JavaScript Using Functional Programming

Summary:
This demonstration illustrates implementing the factory software design pattern in JavaScript using a functional programming approach. We'll utilize `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions where applicable. After presenting the implementation, I'll outline the pros and cons of each usage of the functional style in the solution.

Implementation:
```javascript
// Define a factory function
const factory = type => {
  switch (type) {
    case 'ProductA':
      return { name: 'Product A', price: 10 };
    case 'ProductB':
      return { name: 'Product B', price: 20 };
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid product type');
  }
};

// Example usage of the factory
const productA = factory('ProductA');
const productB = factory('ProductB');
console.log(productA, productB);

// Using map, filter, and reduce
const productTypes = ['ProductA', 'ProductB'];

const factoryUsingFP = types =>
  types.map(type => {
    switch (type) {
      case 'ProductA':
        return { name: 'Product A', price: 10 };
      case 'ProductB':
        return { name: 'Product B', price: 20 };
      default:
        throw new Error('Invalid product type');
    }
  });

const productsUsingFP = factoryUsingFP(productTypes);
console.log(productsUsingFP);
```

Pros and Cons of Functional Style Usage:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Clarity**: Functional programming often leads to cleaner, more readable code due to its focus on functions and immutability.
   - **Composition**: Functions can be composed together easily, allowing for reusable and modular code.
   - **Avoids Side Effects**: Emphasizes immutability, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects.
   - **Concurrency**: Immutability makes it easier to reason about concurrent code.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Performance Overhead**: Functional programming can sometimes lead to performance overhead due to the creation of new data structures instead of mutating existing ones.
   - **Learning Curve**: Functional programming concepts can be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms, leading to a steeper learning curve.
   - **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging functional code, especially deeply nested compositions, can be challenging compared to imperative code.
   - **Abstraction Overhead**: Overusing functional abstractions like map, filter, and reduce can sometimes obfuscate the intent of the code for those unfamiliar with functional programming paradigms.
