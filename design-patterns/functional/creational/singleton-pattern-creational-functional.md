Singleton Software Design Pattern in JavaScript Using Functional Programming

Summary:
This demonstration showcases implementing the singleton software design pattern in JavaScript using a functional programming approach. We'll employ `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions where applicable. After presenting the implementation, I'll outline the pros and cons of each usage of the functional style in the solution.

Implementation:
```javascript
// Define the singleton instance using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
const Singleton = (() => {
  let instance;

  const createInstance = () => ({
    // Singleton properties and methods
    name: 'Singleton Instance',
    // Example method
    greet() {
      console.log('Hello from singleton instance!');
    },
  });

  return {
    // Method to get the singleton instance
    getInstance() {
      if (!instance) {
        instance = createInstance();
      }
      return instance;
    },
  };
})();

// Example usage of the singleton
const singletonInstance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const singletonInstance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(singletonInstance1 === singletonInstance2); // Outputs: true

// Using map, filter, and reduce
const singletonInstances = Array.from({ length: 3 }, () => Singleton.getInstance());

console.log(singletonInstances);
```

Pros and Cons of Functional Style Usage:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Clarity**: Functional programming often leads to cleaner, more readable code due to its focus on functions and immutability.
   - **Composition**: Functions can be composed together easily, allowing for reusable and modular code.
   - **Avoids Side Effects**: Emphasizes immutability, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects.
   - **Concurrency**: Immutability makes it easier to reason about concurrent code.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Performance Overhead**: Functional programming can sometimes lead to performance overhead due to the creation of new data structures instead of mutating existing ones.
   - **Learning Curve**: Functional programming concepts can be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms, leading to a steeper learning curve.
   - **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging functional code, especially deeply nested compositions, can be challenging compared to imperative code.
   - **Abstraction Overhead**: Overusing functional abstractions like map, filter, and reduce can sometimes obfuscate the intent of the code for those unfamiliar with functional programming paradigms.
