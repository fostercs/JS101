Builder Software Design Pattern in JavaScript Using Functional Programming

Summary:
In this demonstration, I'll show you how to implement the builder software design pattern in JavaScript using a functional programming approach. We'll use the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions where applicable. After providing the implementation, I'll summarize the pros and cons of each usage of the functional style in the solution.

Implementation:
```javascript
// Define a builder function
const builder = () => ({
  items: [],
  addItem(item) {
    this.items.push(item);
    return this;
  },
  build() {
    return this.items;
  },
});

// Example usage of the builder
const result = builder()
  .addItem('Item 1')
  .addItem('Item 2')
  .addItem('Item 3')
  .build();

console.log(result);

// Using map, filter, and reduce
const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];

const builderUsingFP = items =>
  items.map(item => ({ name: item })).filter(item => item.name !== 'Item 2').reduce((acc, item) => {
    acc.push(item.name);
    return acc;
  }, []);

const resultUsingFP = builderUsingFP(items);
console.log(resultUsingFP);
```

Pros and Cons of Functional Style Usage:
1. **Pros**:
   - **Clarity**: Functional programming often leads to cleaner, more readable code due to its focus on functions and immutability.
   - **Composition**: Functions can be composed together easily, allowing for reusable and modular code.
   - **Avoids Side Effects**: Emphasizes immutability, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects.
   - **Concurrency**: Immutability makes it easier to reason about concurrent code.

2. **Cons**:
   - **Performance Overhead**: Functional programming can sometimes lead to performance overhead due to the creation of new data structures instead of mutating existing ones.
   - **Learning Curve**: Functional programming concepts can be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to imperative or object-oriented paradigms, leading to a steeper learning curve.
   - **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging functional code, especially deeply nested compositions, can be challenging compared to imperative code.
   - **Abstraction Overhead**: Overusing functional abstractions like map, filter, and reduce can sometimes obfuscate the intent of the code for those unfamiliar with functional programming paradigms.
